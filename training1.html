                In visions of the dark night<br>
                I have dreamed of joy departed<br>
                But a waking dream of life and light<br>
                Hath left me broken-hearted.<br>
                <br>
                Ah! what is not a dream by day <br>
                To him whose eyes are cast <br>
                On things around him with a ray <br>
                Turned back upon the past? <br>
                <br>
                That holy dream—that holy dream,<br>
                While all the world were chiding,<br>
                Hath cheered me as a lovely beam <br>
                A lonely spirit guiding. <br>
                <br>
                What though that light, thro' storm and night, <br>
                So trembled from afar— <br>
                What could there be more purely bright <br>
                In Truth's day-star? <br>
